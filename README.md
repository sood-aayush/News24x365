## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.
### Prerequisites* 
[Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version 3.x or higher recommended)* 
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) / [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Flutter extensions* An Android or iOS emulator/device
### Installation1.  **Clone the repository:** ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/news_app.git](https://github.com/your-username/news_app.git)
    cd news_app
    ```2.  **Install dependencies:** ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```3.  **Generate Launcher Icons:** Ensure you have your `logo.jpg` (or `logo.png` - recommended for transparency) in the `assets/` folder.
    ```bash
    flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
    ```4.  **Update App Name (Optional):** * **Android:** In `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, change `android:label` in the `<application>` tag.    * **iOS:** In `ios/Runner/Info.plist`, modify `CFBundleDisplayName` and `CFBundleName`.5.  **Run the app:** ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    To build a release APK for Android:
    ```bash
    flutter build apk --release
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Configuration Notes* 
**API Base URL:** The app is configured to fetch news from `https://news24x365.com/wp-json/wp/v2`. If you wish to use a different WordPress API, update the `_baseUrl` constant in `lib/services/api_service.dart`.* **Notification Icon:** For Android notifications, ensure you have an `ic_notification.png` in `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/` (or update the reference in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `lib/services/notification_service.dart`).* **Payload Handling:** When a notification is tapped, the app attempts to navigate to the Post Detail Screen using the post ID passed in the notification payload. Ensure your `ApiService` can retrieve a single post by ID if needed, or adjust the payload to contain enough information for direct navigation.

## üìà Future Enhancements* 
**Push Notifications (FCM):** Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging for server-sent "breaking news" alerts.* **Background Fetching:** Use `workmanager` or native background tasks to periodically check for new posts even when the app is closed.* **Offline Reading:** Implement local caching for articles to allow reading without an internet connection.* **User Authentication:** Allow users to log in for personalized features (e.g., commenting, saving articles to a cloud account).* **Deep Linking:** Improve navigation from notifications and external links.* **Better Error Handling UI:** More user-friendly error messages and retry options.* **Pull-to-Refresh:** Implement pull-to-Refresh on content lists.
